1.  What is the time complexity of your solution?  You must explain the stated com-
    plexity.  If you have a different complexity for each problem,  you need to discuss
    them separately.

    - Realizability
        O(V + E)
        The algorithm checks at an arbitrary task. A DFS is performed untill the end is reached, or a cycle is found.
        When all tasks that can be reached from a task is searched, and no cycle is found, this task is marked as 
        "finished" and would not be a next starting task for DFS. The algorithm would continue to do DFS on unmarked tasks untill
        all tasks in the plan is searched. This means the algorithm checkes for the number of tasks and all the edges.        
    
    - Optimal time schedule
        O(V + E)
        This algorithm requires that there are no cycles in the graph, which means that the Realizability must be checked prior
        to running this algorithm.
        The algorithm starts at an arbitrary task A in the plan. A DFS is performed from this task A to a task B that does not have
        any dependencies, and is at "start" of the plan. The early_start and early_finish attribute for this task B is calculated.
        The recursion returns to the task C at the higher level and continue to calculate attributes for the dependencies of this task C.
        When the time attributes are calculated for all of the dependencies for this task, the time attribute for the current task C
        will be calculate from the max(early_finish) of the dependencies. The recursion continues and terminates when it returns to task A, and calculates
        for task A. The algorithm will start over again with another task that has not been calculated untill all tasks are calculated.
        This algorithm visites all the tasks in the plan once and checks every edge once.

    - Latest start, slack and critical tasks
        O(V + E)
        This algorithm uses the ending time of a project, therefore the Optimal time schedule algorithm must ran prior to running
        this algorithm.
        The algorithm starts at an arbitrary task in the plan. A DFS is performed from this task A to a task B that has no tasks that come
        after, or "decent" from task B. This means task B is at the "end" of the plan and slack, late_start, late_finish and critical task
        can be calculated using the project finish time. The recursion returns to the higher level much like in the Optimal time schedule algorithm. 
        When all slack-attribute are calculate for the decendents, the earliest "late_start" of the decendents would be compared to this tasks early_finish,
        and the slack-attributes will be calculated with that value. When this recursion terminates, the algorithm would find a task that have not been visited
        and start the recursion again, until all tasks are calculate.
        The algorithm visites all the tasks in the plan once and checks every edge once.

        

2.  What  requirements  are  there  for  the  input  graph  in  order  for  the  project  to  be
    successfully planned?  Please put the discussion in the light of graf theoretical prop-
    erties.

    I think the input graph must be directed and asyclical.



3.  What kind of the graph algorithms did you use in your implementation?

    I used DFS.
