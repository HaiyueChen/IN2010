1.  How to compile your program (ie.  javac *.java)
    javac *.java

2.  Which file includes the main-method
    Main.java includes the main-method.


3.  Any assumptions you have made when implementing the assignment
    I assume the removeLast() for LinkedList has O(1).


4.  Any peculiarities about your implementation
    In my implementation, the set_early method calculates the early_start/stop,
    and is a prerequisit for the calculation of set_late.

5.  The status of your delivery (what works and what does not)
    Everything works.


6.  Give credit if your code is heavily influenced by some source (ie.  teaching
    material)
    The detecht_cycle method is the same from the lecture and the DFS is taken from teaching materials.
